  "lyrics": "I was (G)working in the lab late one night, \nwhen my (Em)eyes beheld an eerie sight\nFor my (C)monster from the slab began to rise, \nand (D)suddenly, to my surprise\n \n[chorus]\nHe did the (G)mash... (He did the Monster Mash).. \nThe Monster (Em)Mash... (It was a graveyard smash)\nHe did the (C)mash... (It caught on in a flash)... \nHe did the (D)mash... (He did the Monster Mash)\n \nFrom my (G)laboratory in the Castle East, \nto the (Em)Master Bedroom where the vampires feast\nThe (C)ghouls all came from their humble abode, \nto (D)get a jolt from my electrode\n \n[chorus]\nAnd do the (G)mash... (And do the Monster Mash)... \nThe monster (Em)mash... (And do my graveyard smash)\nTo do the (C)mash... (They caught on in a flash)... \nTo do the (D)mash... (To do the monster mash)\n \nThe (G)scene was rocking all were digging the sound, \n(Em)Igor on chains backed by His Baying Hounds\nThe (C)Coffin Bangers were about to arrive, \nWith their (D)vocal group, the Crypt Kicker Five\n \n[chorus]\nThe (C)Zombies were having fun... (In-a-shoop-wha-ooo)... \nThe (D)party had just begun... (In-a-shoop-wha-ooo)\nThe (C)guests included Wolfman... (In-a-shoop-wha-ooo) \n[stop] … (D)Dracula and his son.. (Drum fill)\n \n(G) Out from his coffin Drac's voice did ring, \nIt (Em) seems he was worried 'bout just one thing \n(C) Opened the lid and shook his fist, and said, \n(D)\"Whatever hoppened to my Transylvania Tvist?\"\n \n[chorus]\nIt's now the (G)mash... (It's now the Monster Mash)... \nThe monster (Em)mash... (And it's a graveyard smash)\nIt's now the (C)mash... (It's caught on in a flash) … \nIt's now the (D)mash... (It's now the Monster Mash)\n \nNow (G)everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band, \nand my (Em)Monster Mash, it's the hit of the land\nFor (C)you, the living, this Mash was meant, too… \nwhen you (D)get to my door, tell them Boris sent you!\n \n[chorus]\nAnd you can (G)Mash... (And you can Monster Mash) ...\nThe monster (Em)mash... (And do my graveyard Smash)\nAnd you can (C)Mash... (You'll catch on in a flash)... \nThen you can (D)Mash... (Then you can Monster Mash)\n[end]",
